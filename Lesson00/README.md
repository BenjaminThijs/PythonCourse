# Installing Python

To begin writing scripts in Python and run code, we first need to make sure Python is installed. \
There are many different versions of python available, but for this course we will be using Python3. \
More specifically Python 3.8+. \
\
To install Python, download it [here](https://www.python.org/downloads/). \
Make sure to select the correct OS. \
Also make sure the download version is at least Python 3.8 or higher. \
\
The actual installation is simply following the steps given by the installer. \
There is only one **IMPORTANT** thing to keep in mind during installation. \
We will need to use python through commands, this means it needs to be installed and added to your PATH. \
During the installation an option will be presented to do this for you. \
 - TODO: Add picture of option here?
If an issue arises during the installation, then this is the perfect time to brush up your googling skills :)

# Using Python

If the installation of Python went well, you should be able to open a terminal and call Python. \
**On Windows** You can open the start-menu (windows key on the keyboard) and type `cmd`. \
**On Linux** You can press `ctrl-alt-T` to open a new terminal. \
**On Mac** You can go to Google, and find out how to open a terminal. \
\
Once a terminal window is open, simply type `python`. \
It should look like this. (example is on Linux) \
