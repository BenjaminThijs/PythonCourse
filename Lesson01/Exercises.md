# Exercises

In each lesson, a folder has been created for you to put your answers (nobody but you will be able to see them, they will not become part of this course's repository). \
Each seperate exercise also contains a folder to put the answer in. \
It is not required to use these folders, but it is encouraged, since at later points these folders might contain some starting code. \
\
Each exercise also has a difficulty level, shown using stars. More stars equals more difficult. (difficulty is based on the lesson, not an overall score)
